# Memory Game Project

This Memory Game is created using jQery. 

## How to Play:

 The user is to click on the cards in order to find the matching cards. The goal is to quickly find all of the matches in the fewest moves as possible. A three star game is eight moves, two star game is nine to thirteen moves, and more than fourteen moves is a one star game. When the cards match they will turn green and stay turned over, but if the two cards that do not match the cards will turn red and flip back over. Each possible match is considered to be one move. The time will start as soon as you click on your first card. Make sure to remember what the unmatched cards are!
